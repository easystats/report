report_sample(
  data,
  group_by = NULL,
  centrality = "mean",
  ci = NULL,
  ci_method = "wilson",

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame for which descriptive statistics should be created.}

\item{group_by}{Character vector, indicating the column for possible grouping
of the descriptive table.}

\item{centrality}{Character, indicates the statistics that should be
calculated for numeric variables. May be \code{"mean"} (for mean and
standard deviation) or \code{"median"} (for median and median absolute
deviation) as summary.}

\item{ci}{Level of confidence interval for relative frequencies (proportions).
If not \code{NULL}, confidence intervals are shown for proportions of factor
levels.}

\item{ci_method}{Character, indicating the method how to calculate confidence
intervals for proportions. Currently implemented methods are \code{"wald"} and
\code{"wilson"}. Note that \code{"wald"} can produce intervals outside the plausible
range of [0, 1], and thus it is recommended to prefer the \code{"wilson"} method.
The formulae for the confidence intervals are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"wald"}:

\deqn{p \pm z \sqrt{\frac{p (1 - p)}{n}}}
\item \code{"wilson"}:

\deqn{\frac{2np + z^2 \pm z \sqrt{z^2 + 4npq}}{2(n + z^2)}}

where \code{p} is the proportion (of a factor level), \code{q} is \code{1-p}, \code{z} is the
critical z-score based on the interval level and \code{n} is the length of the
vector (cf. \emph{Newcombe 1998}, \emph{Wilson 1927}).
}}

\item{ci_correct}{Logical, it \code{TRUE}, applies continuity correction. See
\emph{Newcombe 1998} for different correction-methods based on the chosen
\code{ci_method}.}

\item{select}{Character vector, with column names that should be included in
the descriptive table.}

\item{exclude}{Character vector, with column names that should be excluded
from the descriptive table.}

\item{weights}{Character vector, indicating the name of a potential
weight-variable. Reported descriptive statistics will be weighted by
\code{weight}.}

\item{total}{Add a \code{Total} column.}

\item{digits}{Number of decimals.}

\item{n}{Logical, actual sample size used in the calculation of the
reported descriptive statistics (i.e., without the missing values).}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
A data frame of class \code{report_sample} with variable names and
their related summary statistics.
