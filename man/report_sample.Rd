\usage{
report_sample(
  data,
  group_by = NULL,
  centrality = "mean",
  ci = NULL,
  ci_adjust = NULL,
  select = NULL,
  exclude = NULL,
  weights = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame for which descriptive statistics should be created.}

\item{group_by}{Character vector, indicating the column for possible grouping
of the descriptive table.}

\item{centrality}{Character, indicates the statistics that should be
calculated for numeric variables. May be \code{"mean"} (for mean and
standard deviation) or \code{"median"} (for median and median absolute
deviation) as summary.}

\item{ci}{Level of confidence interval for relative frequencies (proportions).
If not \code{NULL}, confidence intervals are shown for proportions of factor
levels. If \code{p} is the proportion of a factor level, the related confidence
interval is calculated as follows:

\deqn{p +/- z \sqrt{\frac{p (1 - p)}{n}}}

where \code{z} is the critical z-score based on the interval level and \code{n} is
the length of the vector.}

\item{ci_adjust}{Scalar, if not \code{NULL}, applies \emph{Wilson's adjustment} to
confidence intervals of proportions that are close to 0 or 1. \code{ci_adjust}
must be a value between 0 and 1, indicating how close a proportions must
be to 0 or 1 in order to apply the adjustment to its confidence intervals.
E.g., if \code{ci_adjust = 0.07}, confidence intervals of all proportions smaller
than 0.07 or greater than 0.93 will be adjusted. Their calculation is as
follows:

\deqn{p +/- z \sqrt{\frac{p (1 - p)}{n + 4}}}

where \code{p} is

\deqn{p = \frac{x + 2}{n + 4}}}

\item{select}{Character vector, with column names that should be included in
the descriptive table.}

\item{exclude}{Character vector, with column names that should be excluded
from the descriptive table.}

\item{weights}{Character vector, indicating the name of a potential
weight-variable. Reported descriptive statistics will be weighted by
\code{weight}.}

\item{total}{Add a \code{Total} column.}

\item{digits}{Number of decimals.}

\item{n}{Logical, actual sample size used in the calculation of the
reported descriptive statistics (i.e., without the missing values).}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
A data frame of class \code{report_sample} with variable names and
their related summary statistics.

Create sample description table (also referred to as "Table 1").
