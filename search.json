Set up user library first: `mkdir -p ~/R/library && echo 'R_LIBS_USER=~/R/library' >> ~/.Renviron`   2. Use explicit library path: `install.packages(\"package\", lib = \"~/R/library\", repos=\"...\")`   3. Alternatively, restart R session after step 1 and then use: `install.packages(\"package\", lib = .libPaths()[1], repos=\"...\")` - **Prevention**: All install.packages calls in these instructions now include the `lib = .libPaths()[1]` parameter, but you must set up user library directory first - **Note**: This issue occurs when the pre-configured environment setup doesn't run and R defaults to system library locations  ### Missing Package Errors - **Cause**: Suggested packages not installed - **Solution**: Install via `sudo apt install r-cran-[package]` or ignore if testing core functionality  ### Network/CRAN Access Issues - **Cause**: Blocked network access to CRAN mirrors - **Solution**: Use system packages via apt or skip optional package tests  ### Test Snapshot Failures - **Cause**: Minor precision differences in numerical results (normal) - **Solution**: Review changes, accept if precision differences are minor: `testthat::snapshot_accept()`  ### Build Failures - **Cause**: Syntax errors, missing dependencies, or file issues - **Solution**: Check specific error messages, ensure DESCRIPTION is correct, verify all R files have valid syntax  ### Styler Not Available - **Cause**: styler package not installed - **Solution**: Install via R: `R --no-restore --no-save -e 'install.packages(\"styler\", lib = .libPaths()[1], repos=c(\"https://r-universe.dev\", \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))'` or skip styling step if not critical  ### Roxygen2 Not Available - **Cause**: roxygen2 package not installed - **Solution**: Install via R: `R --no-restore --no-save -e 'install.packages(\"roxygen2\", lib = .libPaths()[1], repos=c(\"https://r-universe.dev\", \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))'` or use devtools: `R --no-restore --no-save -e 'devtools::document()'`  ### Documentation Build Failures - **Cause**: Documentation not updated after changing roxygen2 comments - **Solution**: Run `R --no-restore --no-save -e 'roxygen2::document()'` before building the package  ### Global Variable Binding Warnings (\"no visible binding\") - **Cause**: Using bare variable names in dplyr/ggplot2 operations instead of proper notation - **Solution**: Replace with `.data[[variable_name]]` notation and add proper `@importFrom` statements - **Example**: Change `group_by(var)` to `group_by(.data[[var]])` - **DO NOT**: Create `global_variables.R` files with `utils::globalVariables()`  ### Lintr CI vs Local Discrepancies (CRITICAL VERSION ISSUE) - **Cause**: CI uses development lintr (`r-lib/lintr`) while local uses CRAN stable (`r-cran-lintr`) - **Symptoms**: Local lintr passes but CI lintr fails with stricter rules - **Root issue**: Development lintr has stricter rules and different function preferences - **Solution**: Always install development lintr to match CI. Priority order: r-universe first, then remotes fallback:   ```bash   # Install development lintr to match CI - check if already installed first   R --no-restore --no-save -e '   if (!requireNamespace(\"lintr\", quietly = TRUE)) {     # Set GitHub token if available to avoid rate limits (use GH_PAT directly)     if (Sys.getenv(\"GH_PAT\") != \"\") {       Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = Sys.getenv(\"GH_PAT\"))     }     # Priority order: r-universe FIRST, then remotes as fallback     # Based on testing with whitelisted r-lib.r-universe.dev and cdn.r-universe.dev: both r-universe and remotes work successfully     tryCatch({       # FIRST PRIORITY: Try r-universe installation       install.packages(\"lintr\", lib = .libPaths()[1], repos=c(\"https://r-lib.r-universe.dev\", \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))       cat(\"SUCCESS: r-universe installation worked\\n\")     }, error = function(e1) {       cat(\"r-universe installation failed, trying remotes...\\n\")       tryCatch({         # FALLBACK: Use remotes for development lintr installation         if (!requireNamespace(\"remotes\", quietly = TRUE)) {           install.packages(\"remotes\", lib = .libPaths()[1], repos=c(\"https://r-universe.dev\", \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))         }         remotes::install_github(\"r-lib/lintr\")         cat(\"SUCCESS: remotes installation worked\\n\")       }, error = function(e2) {         cat(\"CRITICAL ERROR: Cannot install development lintr from any source\\n\")         cat(\"Tried: 1) r-universe (failed), 2) remotes (failed)\\n\")         cat(\"This is required for proper linting that matches CI environment.\\n\")         cat(\"COPILOT MUST STOP and report this issue in the PR.\\n\")         cat(\"User must resolve lintr installation before continuing.\\n\")         stop(\"Development lintr installation failed - cannot proceed\")       })     })   } else {     cat(\"Development lintr already installed.
