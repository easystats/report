    Provides utilities to describe posterior distributions and Bayesian models.
    It includes point-estimates such as Maximum A Posteriori (MAP), measures of
    dispersion (Highest Density Interval - HDI; Kruschke, 2015
    <doi:10.1016/C2012-0-00477-2>) and indices used for null-hypothesis testing
    (such as ROPE percentage, pd and Bayes factors).

    A tool to provide an easy, intuitive and consistent access to information
    contained in various R models, like model formulas, model terms, information
    about random effects, data that was used to fit the model or data from
    response variables. 'insight' mainly revolves around two types of functions:
    Functions that find (the names of) information, starting with 'find_', and
    functions that get the underlying data, starting with 'get_'. The package
    has a consistent syntax and works with many different model objects, where
    otherwise functions to access these information are missing.

    Utilities for computing measures to assess model quality, which are not

    measures like r-squared, intraclass correlation coefficient (Nakagawa,
    Johnson & Schielzeth (2017) <doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0213>), root mean squared
    error or functions to check models for overdispersion, singularity or
    zero-inflation and more. Functions apply to a large variety of regression
    models, including generalized linear models, mixed effects models and
    Bayesian models.

    The see package is embedded in the easystats ecosystem, a collection of R
    packages that operate in synergy to provide a consistent and intuitive
    syntax when working with statistical models in the R programming language (R
    Core Team, 2021). Most easystats packages return comprehensive numeric summaries
    of model parameters and performance. The see package complements these numeric
    summaries with a host of functions and tools to produce a range of
    publication-ready visualizations for model parameters, predictions, and
    performance diagnostics. As a core pillar of easystats, the see package helps
    users to utilize visualization for more informative, communicable, and well-rounded
    scientific reporting.
