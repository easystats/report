      We fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using REML and nloptwrap optimizer) to predict Reaction with Days (formula: Reaction ~ Days). The model included Days and Subject as random effects (formula: ~1 + Days | Subject). The model's total explanatory power is substantial (conditional R2 = 0.80) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.28. The model's intercept, corresponding to Days = 0, is at 251.41 (95% CI [237.94, 264.87], t(174) = 36.84, p < .001). Within this model:
      
        - The effect of Days is statistically significant and positive (beta = 10.47, 95% CI [7.42, 13.52], t(174) = 6.77, p < .001; Std. beta = 0.54, 95% CI [0.38, 0.69])
      
      Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using

      We fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using REML and nloptwrap optimizer) to predict Reaction with Days (formula: Reaction ~ Days). The model included mysubgrp, mygrp and Subject as random effects (formula: list(~1 | mysubgrp:mygrp, ~1 | mygrp, ~1 | Subject)). The model's explanatory power related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is 0.49. The model's intercept, corresponding to Days = 0, is at 252.09 (95% CI [232.50, 271.69], t(174) = 25.39, p < .001). Within this model:
