# report_s

    Code
      report_s(s = 4.2)
    Message <simpleMessage>
      If the test hypothesis and entire model (all assumptions) were true,
        there is a 5.4% chance of observing this outcome. How weird is that?
        It's hardly more surprising than getting 4 heads in a row with fair coin
        tosses.
