      We fitted a logistic model to predict Surv(futime, fustat) with ecog.ps, rx
      (formula: Surv(futime, fustat) ~ ecog.ps + rx). The model's explanatory power
      is weak (Nagelkerke's R2 = 0.07). The model's intercept, corresponding to
      ecog.ps = 0, rx = 0, is at 667.43 (95% CI [-415.59, 1750.45], p = 0.227).
      Within this model:
      
        - The effect of ecog ps is statistically non-significant and negative (beta =
      -210.59, 95% CI [-726.18, 305.01], p = 0.423; Std. beta = -107.06, 95% CI
      [-369.19, 155.07])
        - The effect of rx is statistically non-significant and positive (beta =
      320.10, 95% CI [-194.11, 834.32], p = 0.222; Std. beta = 163.22, 95% CI
      [-98.98, 425.42])
        - The effect of Log(scale) is statistically significant and positive (beta =
      5.82, 95% CI [5.35, 6.29], p < .001; Std. beta = 5.82, 95% CI [5.35, 6.29])
      
      Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized
      version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were
      computed using a Wald z-distribution approximation.
