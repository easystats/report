    Output
      We fitted a constant (intercept-only) linear model (estimated using OLS) to
      predict d_wide$group0 - d_wide$group1 (formula: d_wide$group0 - d_wide$group1 ~
      1). The model's intercept is at -1.58 (95% CI [-2.46, -0.70], t(9) = -4.06, p =
      0.003).
      
      Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized
      version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were
      computed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
